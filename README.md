## Interface Specifications & Data Model
Interface specifications are provided through Swagger. 
* Swagger API docs - http://localhost:8080/telephoneInquiry/v2/api-docs
* Swagger UI - http://localhost:8080/telephoneInquiry/swagger-ui.html

## Data Model
Data models can also be accessed from the Swagger UI link under Models. Simple Data model (white boarded) can be accessed from [here](https://github.com/aarunbala/telecom-challenge/blob/master/src/main/resources/DataModel.jpg)

Based on my intrepretation of the provided document, I assumed that all the Phone Numbers will have an association with a Customer in the database and there will not be any orphaned phone numbers (not associated with a customer) available for the purposes of this exercise. 

```
CustomerProfile{
    customerId	string
    name	string
    services	[Service{
                            activated	boolean
                            activatedTime	string($date-time)
                            phoneNumber	string
                 }]
}
```
